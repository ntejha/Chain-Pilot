chains more vulnerable to cyber threats.6 Sub-tier suppliers can represent weak points and potential entry for cyberattacks.95 Robust cybersecurity measures are therefore crucial, including comprehensive vendor risk management processes to assess and monitor the security posture of all partners.62 Continuous monitoring for suspicious activities and vulnerabilities is essential.62 Implementing data encryption protocols helps protect sensitive information.62 Regular cybersecurity training for employees and suppliers is vital to raise awareness and mitigate human error.62 Leveraging technologies like Digital Twins can also enhance visualization of the entire network and help identify potential vulnerabilities.62 Overcoming labor shortages and skill gaps presents a significant hurdle for many organizations. Shortages of skilled workers in critical areas like warehousing, transport, and manufacturing can disrupt operations and increase costs.62 The increasing complexity of modern supply chains and the rapid adoption of new technologies have led to a rising demand for professionals with specialized skills in areas like data analytics, AI, and robotics.65 To address this challenge, organizations need to invest in talent development initiatives, including upskilling and reskilling existing employees to meet the evolving demands of the industry.2 Attracting and retaining new talent through competitive compensation, career development opportunities, and a positive work environment is also crucial.65 The increasing integration of generative AI in supply chain operations may also alter job roles, necessitating a focus on developing new skill sets related to technology fluency and adaptability.116 Finally, organizations must navigate the challenge of adapting to evolving regulatory and compliance requirements. The number of regulations related to sustainability and environmental impact is growing, including initiatives like the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).62 Staying informed about and compliant with new trade and tariff policies is also essential.62 There is an increasing focus on ESG reporting, requiring companies to track and disclose their environmental and social performance throughout the supply chain, including compliance with regulations like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.62 Technology plays a vital role in facilitating compliance by enabling efficient data collection, analysis, and reporting, helping organizations navigate this increasingly complex regulatory landscape.67 Risk Category Specific Risk Examples Potential Impact Geopolitical Instability Trade wars, sanctions, political Disruption of trade flows, unrest, armed conflicts increased costs due to tariffs, supplier instability, delays.
